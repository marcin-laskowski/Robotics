The following materials introduces the concepts and main components of robotics - the intelligent connection of sensing to action. It also presents the basics of modelling, design, planning, control and adaptation of robot systems. Tutorials with examples enabling to assimilate the material, and practical lab sessions where the person get to physically interact with robotic systems and challenge their understanding of the material.
